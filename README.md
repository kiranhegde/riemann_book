## Outline
Parentheticals indicate concepts introduced for the first time.

- [Prologue: background and motivation](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/wiki/Introductory-notebook-outline)

**Part I: Exact Riemann solutions**
1. [Advection](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Advection.ipynb)
1. [Acoustics](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Acoustics.ipynb) (eigenvalue analysis, characteristics, similarity solutions)
2. [Traffic flow](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Traffic_flow.ipynb) (shocks, rarefactions, conservation, jump conditions)
3. Burgers' (weak solutions)
4. [Shallow water](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Shallow_tracer.ipynb) (jump conditions for a nonlinear system; Riemann invariants, integral curves, Hugoniot Loci) (see also [this](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/faculty.washington.edu/rjl/notebooks/shallow/SW_riemann_tester.ipynb) and [this](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/rjleveque/8994740))
5. How to solve the Riemann problem exactly -- go in depth into SW solver, including Newton iteration to find root of piecewise function
5. Shallow water with a tracer (contact waves)
5. [Euler equations](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Euler_equations.ipynb)

**Part II: Approximate solvers**
1. Motivation and approaches to approximate solvers (waves vs fluxes)
1. Transonic rarefactions and entropy fixes
2. Linearized solvers (Roe) (non-physical solutions)
3. LLF and HLL and extensions (smearing of contacts)
4. Comparison of solvers for shallow water
5. Comparison of solvers for Euler
6. Comparison of full numerical solutions for Woodward-Colella blast wave problem

**Part III: Riemann problems in heterogeneous media**
1. Advection (conservative vs color)
1. Acoustics (conservative vs non-conservative)
2. [Variable speed-limit traffic](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Traffic_variable_speed.ipynb)
3. [Nonlinear elasticity](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Nonlinear_elasticity.ipynb) (forward reference to nonconservative nonlinear problems)
4. Shock tube with different ratio of specific heats
7. [Euler with Tamman EOS](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Euler_equations_TammannEOS.ipynb)


**Part IV: Source terms**
1. Approaches: source at interface vs other approaches (not covered here), well-balancing? stiffness?
1. Scalar example(s) (advection-reaction, traffic with on-ramps, burgers-reaction) (well-balancing)
1. Shallow water with bathymetry
2. Euler with gravity
3. Reactive Euler?
4. Discuss viscous source terms?

**Part V: Non-classical problems**

2. Pressureless gas (non-diagonalizable)
3. (nonconvex flux systems -- MHD?)
4. Nonconservative, nonlinear systems (path-conservative solvers)

**Part VI: Multidimensional systems**
1. Planar Riemann problem for a multi-D system (e.g. [Acoustics](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/maojrs/ipynotebooks/blob/master/acoustics_riemann.ipynb), SW, Euler) (shear waves)
2. [Elasticity](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/maojrs/ipynotebooks/blob/master/elasticity_riemann.ipynb)
3. Quadrants problem (2D Euler Riemann-like problem)
